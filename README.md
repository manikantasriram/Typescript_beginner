This is for the people who just started learning TypeScript.
Please be strong with the JavaScript before starting TpeScript for better understanding.

To compile a "TypeScript" file in the VS Code Editor, use the command
npx tsc index.ts
index.ts - Ths is the name  your TS file.
Any code that we write on the "TypeScript" will be compiled to "JavaScript" because the browser can only understand the JavaScript not TypeScript.
